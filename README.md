### Task & TODO organizer

---

Initial commits

This tool is used as a way to easy access todo items and notes on a certain task.
<br/>&nbsp;Mixed with some freelancer tools I need, like a clock for my hours while working or pending deadlines.

It's mostly that all of the current day notification systems really bother me or give me anxiety with just the sheer mass of data they throw at you.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because seeing everything at once is good.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us don't really operate that way.

It's not as full feature as workflow managers,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is just a todo/task manager mostly.
